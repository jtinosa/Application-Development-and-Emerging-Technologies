# Emerging Technologies

## Overview

Emerging technologies are new or developing technologies that are expected to significantly impact business and society in the next 5-10 years. However, the term can also apply to existing technologies used in innovative ways.

## Characteristics of Emerging Technologies

According to Rotolo, Hicks, and Martin (2015), emerging technologies have five main characteristics:

1. **Radical novelty**: Either completely new or existing technology applied in new ways.
2. **Relatively fast growth**: Rapid increase in adoption, funding, or development.
3. **Coherence**: Convergence of previously separate research streams or technologies.
4. **Prominent impact**: Potential to transform industries or exert significant economic influence.
5. **Uncertainty and ambiguity**: Future applications and outcomes are not fully known or predictable.

## Key Areas of Emerging Technologies

The World Economic Forum identifies several areas of emerging technologies:

1. **Augmented Reality (AR)**
   - Overlays computer-generated content on the real world
   - Applications: navigation, gaming, retail

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
   - Simulation of human intelligence processes by machines
   - Subset: Machine Learning

3. **Quantum Computers**
   - Use quantum mechanics for computation
   - Potential to solve complex problems more efficiently than conventional computers

## The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0)

### Evolution of Industrial Revolutions

1. **Industry 1.0**: Mechanical production (18th century)
   - the introduction of mechanical production using hydroelectric and steam-powered equipment.
2. **Industry 2.0**: Electrically-powered mass production (19th century)
   - New technological systems that use electricity were introduced during this revolution, which allowed for even greater production and more sophisticated machines.
3. **Industry 3.0**: Computer and IT-driven automated production
   - This industrial revolution evolved the use of electronics and information technology (IT) to automate a production process further.
   - Manufacturing and automation advanced considerably because of Internet access, connectivity, and renewable energy.
4. **Industry 4.0**: Current era of smart and autonomous systems
   - The disruptive and cutting-edge technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality (VR), AR, and AI, are changing the way we live and work.
   - Industry 4.0 will lead to changes in traditional production relationships among suppliers, producers, customers, as well as between humans and machines.

### Key Technologies in Industry 4.0

1. **Big Data Analytics**
   - process of collecting, organizing, and analyzing large sets of data from different resources to discover patterns and other useful information.
   - used to support real-time decision-making in production and customer management systems.
   - opens the possibility to analyze large data and immediately get answers from them.
2. **Internet of Things (IoT)**
   - a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the Internet and being able to communicate and interact with other devices (sensors and wireless technologies).
   - allows field devices to interact with one another and with more centralized controllers.
   - It will also decentralize analytics and decision-making, thereby enabling real-time responses and results.
3. **Cloud Computing**
   -  the general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet.
   -  The performance of cloud technologies will improve, which results in achieving reaction times of several milliseconds.
   -  Machine data and functionality will increasingly be deployed to the cloud, thus enabling more data-driven services in production systems.
4. **Augmented Reality (AR)**
   - AR-based systems support a variety of services, such as selecting parts in a warehouse and sending repair instructions over mobile devices.
   - These systems are currently in their infancy, but in the future, companies will make much broader use of AR to provide workers with real-time information to improve decision-making and work procedures.
