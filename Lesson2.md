# Requirements Analysis and Modeling

## Introduction

**Requirements Determination** is a crucial part of systems development, converting high-level user requirements into a detailed **requirements definition report**.

### Systems Development Phases:
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Directly related to system processes or data
- Example: Ability to search for available products

### Non-functional Requirements
1. **Operational requirements**
   - Specify operating environment(s)
2. **Performance requirements**
   - Deal with response time, capacity, reliability
3. **Security requirements**
   - Address access control, data protection
4. **Cultural and political requirements**
   - Consider cultural factors, legal requirements

## Requirements Definition Report

- Also known as requirements specification document
- Lists functional and non-functional requirements
- Defines system scope

### Sample Outline:
1. Revision History
2. Introduction
3. References
4. Specific Requirements
   - Functional Requirements
   - Non-functional Requirements
5. Verification/Document Approvals
6. Appendixes

## Requirements-Gathering Techniques

### 1. Interviews
- Most common technique
- Steps:
  1. Selecting Interviewees
  2. Designing Interview Questions
  3. Prepare for the Interview
  4. Conduct the Interview
  5. Post-Interview Follow-up

### 2. Joint Application Development (JAD)
- Group information-gathering technique
- Steps:
  1. Selecting Participants
  2. Designing JAD Session
  3. Preparing for the JAD Session
  4. Conducting the JAD Session
  5. Post-JAD Follow-up

### 3. Questionnaires
- Used for large groups
- Steps:
  1. Selecting Participants
  2. Designing a Questionnaire
  3. Administering the Questionnaire
  4. Questionnaire Follow-up

### 4. Document Analysis
- Review of existing documents
- Useful for understanding current systems

### 5. Observation
- Watching processes being performed
- Good for validating information from other sources

## Requirements Analysis

### Characteristics of Good Requirements:
1. Necessary
2. Unambiguous
3. Consistent
4. Complete
5. Singular
6. Feasible
7. Verifiable
8. Traceable

### Using Requirements Checklist
- Tool to determine if each requirement is actually needed
- Analyze each requirement against a set of questions

## Modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML)

### Use-Case Diagrams
- Demonstrate functional requirements from user perspective

#### Components:
1. Actors
2. Use-cases
3. Subject boundaries
4. Relationships

## Creating Use-Case Diagrams

### Steps to Identify Major Use-Cases:
1. Review requirements definition
2. Identify subject's boundaries
3. Identify primary and secondary actors and goals
4. Identify business process and major use-cases
5. Review current set of use-cases

### Steps to Draw Use-Case Diagram:
1. Place and draw use-cases
2. Place and draw actors
3. Draw subject boundary
4. Add associations
